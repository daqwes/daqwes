# Hi!
My name is Danila Mokeev and I am a final year student in Applied Mathematics at [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html) in Belgium.
My thesis is on efficient [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) methods for density matrix estimation in [Quantum Tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tomography) (have a look [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05933) for a brief overview). I was previously an exchange student at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) in Finland.

## Job

I am looking for a job for September 2024. If you are looking for a
- Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist
- Software Engineer in C++/Rust

in Western Europe, don't hesitate to send me a [mail](mailto:daniel.mokeev1@gmail.com)! 
See below for more information about me.

## Personal interests
- I am very interested in Probabilistic Machine Learning, notably MCMC, Gaussian Processes, Causal Inference and Bayesian Statistics in general. Bonus points if there is some implementation involved! 
- I really enjoy systems programming and programming languages, anything related to compilers, performance optimizations, databases, operating systems and other low level bits.


## ML Projects
- Exoplanet detection with Conditional Variational Autoencoders with PyTorch
- Predicting solar PV production with State-Space Gaussian Processes with JAX
- Treatment effect estimation (ATE) with Causal Inference using R and Stan


## Dev projects

- Currently going through [PPC](https://ppc-exercises.cs.aalto.fi/course/open2024a) in C++ and [Advanced Systems Programming](https://github.com/ls1-sys-prog-course/docs) in Rust
- Quick sort implentation on single/multi GPU in CUDA and MPI
- Full-stack implementation of a shopping cart with React/Node.js and deployed with Docker
- C projects: Multithreaded KMeans, simplified TCP with sender/receiver


## Past experiences
- Machine Learning Intern at [Aerospacelab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aerospacelab/)
    - Cloud detection in satellite images using Vision Transformers in PyTorch
- Data Engineering Intern at [Riaktr](https://www.linkedin.com/company/riaktr/)
    - ETL development, KPIs calculations, EDA using PySpark, Airflow, Pandas and deploying with Docker
- Python Developer at [MBA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mbamicrobelgiumapplication/)
    - Working with Google APIs and SQL databases to develop internal tooling
